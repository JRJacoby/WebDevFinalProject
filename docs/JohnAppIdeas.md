## 1. Mood-Based Listening
**Description**: Uses Spotfy's API to get data about what music a user listened to when, as well as attributes of that music, and then provides mood-based analyses and recommendations to the user.

**Main Features**:
1. The user can get a 'mood report' (could be simple or detailed) for their listening on a specific day, week, month, year, etc. (think 'Spotify Wrapped' but more flexible and available whenever, and with a heavier focus on the mood/vibe of the music)
2. The user can 'Find Music with this Mood' once they've identified a timespan that they really enjoyed the music from. This will give more far-reaching results than Spotify's default recommandations.
3. The user can 'Share this Mood' to share the playlist+mood label with other users, as well as look at information about other users that they have shared.

**Two types of users**:
1. Looking at your own data shows you everything you could want to know.
2. Someone else looking at your data shows only a subset of all the data, perhaps customizable based on what you've chosen to share.
